🧩 Maze Generator and Solver (C Language)
📌 Project Description

This project is a Maze Generator and Solver implemented in C programming language.
The program generates a random maze using logical rules and then solves it by finding a valid path from the start point to the end point.

🎯 Objectives

To understand 2D arrays in C

To apply logic, recursion, and backtracking

To learn maze generation and pathfinding concepts

🛠️ Features

Random maze generation

Maze displayed using characters (#, , S, E, .)

Automatic maze solving

Clear visualization of the solution path

🧠 Algorithm Used

Maze Generation: Depth First Search (DFS) / Randomized carving

Maze Solving: Backtracking / Recursive path search

🧪 How the Program Works

Initialize the maze with walls

Generate random paths in the maze

Display the generated maze

Solve the maze by finding a path from start to end

Display the solved maze

▶️ How to Run the Program
